    "The Google Cloud CLI works on Windows 8.1 and later and Windows Server 2012 and later.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the [Google Cloud CLI installer](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, open a PowerShell terminal and run the following PowerShell commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\"https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe\", \"$env:Temp\\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe\")\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> & $env:Temp\\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Launch the installer and follow the prompts. The installer is signed by Google LLC.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cloud SDK requires Python; supported versions are Python 3 (3.5 to 3.9). By default, the Windows version of Cloud SDK comes bundled with Python 3. To use Cloud SDK, your operating system must be able to run a supported version of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The installer installs all necessary dependencies, including the needed Python version. While Cloud SDK installs and manages Python 3 by default, you can use an existing Python installation if necessary by **unchecking** the option to Install Bundled Python. See [gcloud topic startup](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/startup) to learn how to use an existing Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After installation is complete, the installer gives you the option to create Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts, start the Google Cloud CLI shell, and configure the gcloud CLI. Make sure that you leave the options to start the shell and configure your installation selected. The installer starts a terminal window and runs the **`gcloud init`** command.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The default installation doesn't include the App Engine extensions required to deploy an application using `gcloud` commands. These components can be installed using the [gcloud CLI component manager](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/managing-components).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting tips:**\n",
    "* If your installation is unsuccessful due to the `find` command not being recognized, ensure your `PATH` environment variable is set to include the folder containing `find`. Usually, this is `C:\\WINDOWS\\system32;`.\n",
    "* If you uninstalled the gcloud CLI, you must reboot your system before installing the gcloud CLI again.\n",
    "* If unzipping fails, run the installer as an administrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Sign into gcloud with your **NCSU** email.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Do not create a new project\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Close all the terminals that are open (SDK and Anaconda).\n",

    "1. Confirm that you have a supported version of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * To check your current Python version, run `python3 -V` or `python -V`. Supported versions are Python 3 (3.5 to 3.9).\n",
    "    * For Cloud SDK release version 352.0.0 and above, the main install script offers to install CPython's Python 3.7 on Intel-based Macs.\n",
    "    * For more information on how to choose and configure your Python interpreter, refer to [gcloud topic startup](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/startup).\n",
